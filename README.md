This is the front-end of the small-scale online voting system known as OV.Seva built for the purpose of conducting campus election, online via the using the blockchain technology.
-> As per defination: Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting votes.

#
OV.Seva behind the scene works in this way, it makes the user to register himself or herself as voter (compulsory) and candidate to contest in election(choice) and then the application
number and password will help in logging in, after logging in the user can edit their details which will be stored in the database. Secondly, after the details are edited and verified
the user can vote, the voting process will be executed via using the blockchain technology.
#
Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a 'digital ledger.

#
The user will vote and the block will be storing the detail, as to who he/she has voted for, the time stamp and the hash of the previous block. Thus, this makes the whole
of the process of voting secure and transparent. If the user, again goes to the place where voting is done he/she will find the time when the vote has been given, and further access willn't be allowed
